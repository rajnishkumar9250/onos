*) autonomous systems (AS) - is a collection of ip address

*) BGP -- a route exchange between autonomous systems

*) External BGP (EBGP) - for use between ASs

*) Internal BGP (IBGP) - for use within them.  


*) VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) -
	--  acts like a physical LAN but it allows hosts to be grouped together in the same broadcast domain even if they are not connected to the same switch

*) Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) - to allow for the presence of multiple independent routing tables working simultaneously on the same router or switch

*) FRRouting (FRR) - A system with FRR installed acts as a dedicated router. With FRR, your machine exchanges routing information with other routers using routing protocols . 
	- FRR uses this information to update the kernel routing table so that the right data goes to the right place
