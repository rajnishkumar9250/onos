*) Network Telemetry - describes how information from various data sources can be collected using a set of automated communication processes and transmitted to one or more receiving equipment for analysis tasks


*) Open Networking Foundation (ONF)

*) OpenFlow Protocol -
	  - defines the interface between an OpenFlow Controller and an OpenFlow switch
	  - allows the OpenFlow Controller(SDN eg : - onos, open daylight) to instruct the OpenFlow switch on how to handle incoming data packets

*) SDN controller
	  - onos is a sdn controller
	  - provides separation between the control plane (controller) and data plane (switch) functions of networks using a protocol that modifies forwarding tables in network switches.

*) P4 - Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors
	  - it is programming language specific to packet forwarding

*) OpenConfig - to automate common tasks in their network environment
			  - to move the networking world to a dynamic, programmable infrastructure
			  - replacement of cli configuration for device deployment
			  - supports the use of vendor-neutral data models for configuring and managing multivendor networks.

*) YANG - Yet Another Next Generation
		- a data modeling language for the definition of data sent over network management protocols such as the NETCONF and RESTCONF
		- modular language representing data structures in an XML tree format 

*) NETCONF & RESTCONF
			-  provides mechanisms to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices
			-  it uses xml based data encoding(eg: -YANG) for the configuration data as well as the protocol messages.

*) gRPC - An open source framework that provides secure and reliable transport of data.
		- a remote procedure call developed by Google for low-latency, scalable distributions with mobile clients communicating to a cloud server
		- carries gNMI, and provides the means to formulate and transmit data and operation requests

*) gNMI Protocol - 
				- is gRPC network management protocol developed by Google
				- providesthe mechanism to install, manipulate, and delete the configuration of network devices
				- also to view operational data.
				- The content provided through gNMI can be modeled using YANG.

*) gNOI - provides operations services, such as rebooting a device, pinging a device, and so on.

*) opendaylight (odl) controller vs onos - sdn controller

*) Stratum  - open source silicon-independent switch operating system for software defined networks. 
			- building an open, minimal production-ready distribution for white box switches.
			- exposes a set of next-generation SDN interfaces including P4Runtime  and OpenConfig,enabling interchangeability of forwarding devices and programmability of forwarding behaviors
			- delivers a complete white box switch solution to realize the ‘software defined’ promise of SDN

*) SONiC - it could use Stratum as implementation of SAI
		 - is used as NOS

*) SAI - 
		- Solution to adapt the Disaggregation
		- the standardized C language based APIs to program the network hardware tables
		- User has to just use the SAI APIs to configure particular network feature of the silicon.
		- a fully open multi-vendor abstraction interface that runs on switching chipsets from Broadcom, Cavium, Mellanox and more. 

*) Network Operating System (NOS) - 
		-  Apart from SONiC(eg of NOS), NOS can be an open switch (OPX), dNOS, ONL etc.
		- it called sai api 

*) Disaggregating Network - 
		- The disaggregation means to decouple the network software and hardware.
		- This is like buying a network silicon from any vendor and then loading a NOS of your choice
		- Switching silicon hardware can be from Cavium, Broadcom, Barefoot, Centec, Mellanox etc. and NOS can be Open Switch (OPX), SONiC, dNOS etc.

*) white box switch - 
		- The network switch developed with the idea of network disaggregation
		- enables ODM vendors to select the switching silicon and open source NOS of their own choice which makes it more scalable and price efficient.

*) BGP 	- a routing protocol used to transfer data and information between different host gateways
		- a Path Vector Protocol (PVP), which maintains paths to different hosts, networks and gateway routers and determines the routing decision based on that.		

*) Data plane 	- refers to all the functions and processes that forward packets/frames from one interface to another.
		- also known as Forwarding Plane
		- Forwards traffic to the next hop along the path to the selected destination network according to control plane logic
		- Data plane packets go through the router

*) Control plane - refers to all the functions and processes that determine which path to use. Routing protocols, spanning tree, ldp, etc are examples.			
		- Makes decisions about where traffic is sent

*) Management plane - is all the functions you use to control and monitor devices.

*) Remote Procedure Call (RPC) -  a protocol that one program can use to request a service from a program located in another computer on a network without having to understand the network's details.
		- is also sometimes known as a function call or a subroutine call.
		- uses the client-server model. 
*) ONIE - an open source initiative that defines an open “install environment” for bare metal network switches
		- Open Network Install Environment (ONIE)
		- enables a bare metal network switch ecosystem where end users have a choice among different network operating systems.

*) ASIC (Application-specific integrated circuit) in switches -
		- is basically a CPU that is not a general purpose CPU but is a CPU for making switching decisions very quickly

*) Open Network Linux - is a Linux distribution for open hardware switches,
		- uses ONIE to install onto on-board flash memory.
		- supports multiple switch fabric APIs including : SAI
		- is compatible with most forwarding agents including : Azure SONiC


*) ONOS - an SDN controller specifically designed for service providers.
		- Intention is to create a software defined network operating systems intended to integrate all network applications
		  and functions in a viritualized format

*) Open vSwitch(OVS) - 
		- is a virtual switch
		- supports OpenFlow protocols

*) Mininet  - A network emulator which can create virtual switches,hosts and connect to SDN controllers
		- can be installed in your laptop and complex networking solutions and topologies can be tested out with ease	
		- a tool to simulate an Open vSwitch-based network topology
		- can write python script to interact with Mininet api
